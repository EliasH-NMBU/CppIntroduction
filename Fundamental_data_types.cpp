
// Cpp is a statically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time.

// Fundamental data types in C++:
// 1. int: Integer
// 2. double: Floating point number
// 3. char: Character
// 4. string: Sequence of characters
// 5. bool: Boolean

// The size of these data types can vary depending on the system you are using.

// The size of an int is at least 16 bits, while the size of a double is at least 32 bits.

// The size of a char is 1 byte, and the size of a bool is system dependent.
